    <p style="font-size: large;"> The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] <br>
        It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred <br>
        to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.[4] <br>
        A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges <br>
        freely and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for<br>
        companionship and their ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are <br>
        recognized by various cat registries.[6] The cat is similar in anatomy to the <br>
        other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth <br>
        and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and <br>
        sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations <br>
        like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as <br>
        cat-specific body language. A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk,<br>
        the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species. It can hear sounds <br>
        too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by<br>
        mice and other small mammals.[7] It secretes and perceives pheromones.[8] <br>
        Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter <br>
        sizes often ranging from two to five kittens.[9] Domestic cats are bred and <br>
        shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy.<br>
        Failure to control breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering, as well as<br>
        abandonment of pets, resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, <br>
        contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species, <br>
        and evoking population control.[10] Cats were first domesticated in the Near East <br>
        around 7500 BC.[11] It was long thought that cat domestication was initiated <br>
        in ancient Egypt, as since around 3100 BC veneration was given to cats in ancient Egypt.[12][13] <br>
        As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States, <br>
        with 95 million cats owned.[14][15][16] In the United Kingdom, around 7.3 million <br>
        cats lived in more than 4.8 million households as of 2019.[17]</p>
