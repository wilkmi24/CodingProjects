<p>Here is a quote about Blue Eyed Dogs</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.playbarkrun.com/dogs-blue-eyes/#:~:text=Keep%20in%20mind%20all%20dogs,number%20of%20major%20health%20concerns%20.">All young puppies are born with varying shades of blue eyes. Some appear to be a little more "green-blue" while others will have blue with spots of brown. Within about 10 - 12 weeks your puppies eyes will mature and begin to turn to their new permanent color.</blockquote>
